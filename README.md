Introduction

The real estate landscape in recent years, marked by challenges such as high mortgage rates and housing shortages, presents a compelling opportunity for predictive analysis. Focusing on Maine and New Hampshire, this study aims to predict property prices by exploring house features and socio-economic factors, particularly health outcomes. Our dataset comprises current listings sourced from Redfin and other tables of population and health data. With objectives set on thorough data preprocessing and predictive modeling, Part 2 builds decision tree, random forest, and boosted tree models, fitting the categorical and continuous ‘PRICE’ response separately. Based on multiple benchmarking metrics used to compare models with different choices of features and hyperparameters, we will discuss which model is most useful in predicting house prices.
